# MVP Development Plan: Codebase Upload, Analysis & Visualization Tool
## Overview

This development plan outlines the steps to create a **Codebase Upload, Analysis & Visualization Tool** MVP tailored for creative, intelligent, non-technical users. The tool will enable users to upload their codebases, automatically parse and analyze the code, and visualize the software architecture through interactive diagrams. The application will be developed for macOS, prioritizing ease of use and clear visual communication.
