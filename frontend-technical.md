# Frontend Technical Standards

This document outlines the frontend technology stack, architecture, and development standards for the Codebase Visualizer project.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Electron.js for cross-platform desktop application
- **UI Library**: React.js (v18+) for component-based UI development
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for predictable state management
- **Styling**: Styled Components with a custom theme system
- **UI Components**: Material-UI (MUI) v5 for consistent visual elements
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for static typing and improved developer experience
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast, modern build process

### Visualization Libraries
- **Diagram Rendering**: D3.js for custom visualization components
- **Chart Components**: React-Vis for statistical data visualization
- **Graph Layout**: Dagre for directed graph layouts
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions

## Architecture

### Component Structure
- **Atomic Design Methodology**:
  - Atoms: Smallest UI elements (buttons, inputs, icons)
  - Molecules: Groups of atoms working together (form fields, cards)
  - Organisms: Complex UI sections (sidebar, toolbars)
  - Templates: Page layouts
  - Pages: Specific instances of templates

### Directory Structure

└── App.tsx            # Main application component
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface over type when defining object shapes
- Proper type declarations for component props
- Avoid use of `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Use generics for reusable components and functions

### Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement error boundaries for critical UI sections
- Extract business logic into custom hooks
- Use memo for performance optimization when appropriate
- Document components with JSDoc

### State Management
- Local component state for UI-only concerns
- Redux for shared application state
- Organize Redux code using Redux Toolkit slices
- Use selectors for deriving data from state
- Implement thunks for async operations

### Styling
- Follow the design system guidelines consistently
- Use theme variables instead of hardcoded values
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Support light and dark mode
- Maintain accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting for large application sections
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for component lazy loading
- Virtualize long lists with react-window
- Optimize re-renders with proper memoization
- Monitor bundle size with import cost plugin

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for component and utility testing
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library for component interaction testing
- **Visual Tests**: Storybook for visual regression testing
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for critical paths

## Visualization Rendering

- Implement virtualization for large diagrams
- Use WebGL rendering for complex visualizations when appropriate
- Optimize SVG rendering with proper clipping and grouping
- Implement zooming and panning with proper level-of-detail
- Cache rendered elements for performance

## Developer Tooling

- ESLint for code quality enforcement
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Commitlint for standardized commit messages
- TypeScript compiler for type checking

## Documentation

- Storybook for component documentation
- JSDoc comments for functions and components
- README for each major directory explaining its purpose
- Maintain up-to-date component API documentation

## Security

### User Data Protection
- Implement secure data storage for user preferences and recent projects
- Clear sensitive data from memory when no longer needed
- Apply proper permission checks before accessing local file system

### Code Upload Security
- Validate all file uploads before processing
- Implement file size and type restrictions
- Scan uploads for potential security issues
- Display clear security notices about data handling to users

### Electron Security Best Practices
- Disable Node.js integration in renderer processes when possible
- Enable contextIsolation for secure IPC communication
- Use a proper Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Keep Electron and dependencies up-to-date with security patches
- Implement proper input sanitization for all user-provided data

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement secure authentication for any cloud features
- Use proper token management and refresh mechanisms
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all operations

## Browser/OS Support

- **macOS**: 10.15 (Catalina) and later
- **Rendering Engine**: Chromium (via Electron)

## Performance Targets

- Initial load time: < 2 seconds
- Time to interactive: < 3 seconds
- Smooth interaction (60fps) for standard diagrams
- Support for codebases up to 100,000 lines of code
