# Unified Testing Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive testing approach for the Codebase Visualizer project, ensuring consistency across frontend and backend components.

## Testing Principles

1. **Shift Left**: Test early and often throughout the development lifecycle
2. **Automation First**: Prioritize automated tests over manual testing
3. **Pyramid Approach**: Build a solid foundation of unit tests, with fewer integration and UI tests
4. **Behavior-Driven**: Focus on user behaviors and expectations
5. **Continuous Testing**: Tests run automatically with code changes

## Test Coverage Targets

- **Overall Code Coverage**: 85% minimum across all components
- **Critical Paths**: 95% coverage for core functionality (parsing, analysis, visualization)
- **UI Components**: 80% coverage for user interface components
- **Utilities/Helpers**: 90% coverage for shared utility functions

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

- **Framework**: Jest for both frontend and backend
- **Purpose**: Verify individual functions, classes, and components work as expected
- **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies and services
- **Running**: Automatic on pre-commit and CI pipeline

### Component Tests

- **Framework**: React Testing Library (frontend)
- **Purpose**: Test React components in isolation
- **Coverage**: User interactions, state changes, and rendering
- **Running**: Automatic on pre-commit and CI pipeline

### Integration Tests

- **Framework**: Jest + Supertest (backend), Playwright (frontend-backend)
- **Purpose**: Verify different parts of the application work together
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API contracts between frontend and backend
  - Data transformation pipelines
  - End-to-end user workflows
- **Running**: Automatic on CI pipeline

### End-to-End Tests

- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Purpose**: Test complete user flows from UI to data persistence
- **Approach**: Simulate real user interactions
- **Scope**: Critical user journeys and workflows
- **Running**: Scheduled on CI pipeline (daily)

### Performance Tests

- **Framework**: Lighthouse, custom performance scripts
- **Purpose**: Verify the application meets performance targets
- **Metrics**:
  - Load time
  - Processing speed
  - Memory usage
  - Responsiveness
- **Running**: Scheduled on CI pipeline (weekly)

### Visual Regression Tests

- **Framework**: Storybook + Chromatic
- **Purpose**: Detect unexpected UI changes
- **Scope**: Key UI components and screens
- **Running**: On significant UI changes

## Test Data Management

- **Test Fixtures**: Shared repository of test data for consistency
- **Seed Data**: Standard datasets for different codebase sizes and languages
- **Snapshots**: Maintained for critical UI components
- **Mocks**: Centralized mock library for external dependencies

## Testing Environment

- **Local Development**: Unit and component tests run locally
- **CI Environment**: Integration, E2E, and performance tests run in CI
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for final verification
- **Ephemeral Environments**: Created for each pull request

## Interface Contract Testing

- **Purpose**: Ensure frontend and backend maintain compatible interfaces
- **Approach**: 
  - Define interface contracts with TypeScript and JSON Schema
  - Automate contract validation in CI pipeline
  - Generate API documentation from contracts
- **Tools**: OpenAPI, json-schema

## Error Testing

- **Error Simulation**: Test application behavior under error conditions
- **Fault Injection**: Deliberately introduce faults to verify recovery
- **Error Handling**: Verify correct propagation and user notification
- **Stress Testing**: Test behavior under resource constraints

## Security Testing

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning of dependencies and code
- **Penetration Testing**: Manual security testing on a schedule
- **Input Validation**: Verify proper handling of malicious inputs
- **Privilege Testing**: Verify proper access controls

## Accessibility Testing

- **Automated Checks**: axe-core for WCAG compliance
- **Manual Testing**: Screen reader compatibility
- **Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Focus**: Keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader compatibility

## Test Reporting and Monitoring

- **Dashboards**: Centralized view of test results and coverage
- **Notifications**: Alerts for test failures and regressions
- **Trends**: Track test metrics over time
- **Documentation**: Automatic test report generation

## Responsibilities

- **Developers**: Write unit and component tests for their code
- **QA Engineers**: Write and maintain integration and E2E tests
- **DevOps**: Maintain CI/CD pipeline and test infrastructure
- **Product Team**: Define acceptance criteria and review test plans

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

1. Write failing test based on requirements
2. Implement minimum code to pass the test
3. Refactor code while maintaining passing tests
4. Repeat for next requirement

## Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of test coverage and effectiveness
- Refactoring of brittle or slow tests
- Updating test strategy based on project needs
- Sharing testing best practices across the team
